    'question1' => 'I know it isn’t standard ninja practice to reveal too many identity details, but who are you guys exactly?',
    'answer1' => 'We’re a small team of highly skilled digital journeymen based in Israel. We love open source, we love disrupting the big business status quo, and we love building helpful tools that are easy to use. We believe that everyone else’s web-based cash flow tools are unnecessarily expensive, clunky and complicated - and we’re bent on proving these beliefs with Invoice Ninja.',

    'question2' => 'How do I get started using Invoice Ninja?',
    'answer2' => 'Just click on the big, yellow "Invoice Now" button on our homepage!',

    'question3' => 'Do you offer customer support?',
    'answer3' => 'We sure do. Support is super important to us. Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:support@invoiceninja.com">support@invoiceninja.com</a> with any questions you might have. We almost always reply within one business day.',

    'question4' => 'Is Invoice Ninja really free? For how long?',
    'answer4' => 'Yes, our basic app is 100% free. Forever and ever. For real. We also offer a paid Pro version of Invoice Ninja (you can learn all about its awesome features <a href="https://www.invoiceninja.com/plans">here</a>), but it\'s important to us that the free version have all of the key features people need to do business.',

    'question5' => 'How is Invoice Ninja able to offer this all for free? How are you making any money?',
    'answer5' => 'We’re mostly in this line of work because we believe it’s high time that a good electronic invoicing tool be available for free. There isn’t much money in it - yet. We do offer a paid <a href="https://www.invoiceninja.com/plans">Pro </a> version of the app that we\'ve souped up with premium features. And when our users open up new accounts with payment processor gateways by clicking on links from our site, we make modest commissions as a gateway affiliate. So if zillions of freelancers and small businesses start running credit card charges through Invoice Ninja, or if scores of users go <a href="https://www.invoiceninja.com/plans">Pro</a>, there’s a decent chance we\'ll recover our investment.',

    'question6' => 'Really? So does that mean you’re not collecting information about me so you can sell me stuff or so that some other company can spam me according to my interests?',
    'answer6' => 'No way. We’re not mining your data, and we’re not selling you out. That wouldn’t be very ninja of us, would it?',

    'question7' => 'But don’t you have access to my merchant and banking accounts?',
    'answer7' => 'Actually, we don’t. When you link an account at a third party financial institution with your Invoice Ninja account, you’re essentially giving our app permission to send money to you and nothing more. This is all managed by the tech teams at your financial service providers, who go to great lengths to ensure their integrations can’t be exploited or abused.',

    'question8' => 'Given that Invoice Ninja is an open source app, how can I be sure that my financial information is safe with you?',
    'answer8' => 'There\'s a big difference between “open source" and “open data.” Anyone who wants to use the code that drives Invoice Ninja to create their own products or to make improvements to ours can do so. It’s available for anyone who wants to download and work with. But that’s just the source code - totally separate from what happens with that code on the Invoice Ninja servers. You’re the only one who has full access to what you\'re doing with our product. For more details on the security of our servers and how we handle our users\' information, please read the next question.',

    'question9' => 'So just how secure is this app?',
    'answer9' => 'Extremely. Data uploaded by our users runs through connections with 256-bit encryption, which is twice as many encryption bits that most bank websites use. We use the TLS 1.0 cryptographic protocol, AES_256_CBC string encryption, SHA1 message authentication and DHE_RSA key exchanges. It’s fancy stuff that we put in place to make sure no one can gain access to your information except you.',

    'question10' => 'How do I remove the small "Created by Invoice Ninja” image from the bottom of my invoices?',
    'answer10' => 'The amazingly affordable <a href="https://www.invoiceninja.com/plans">Pro</a> version of Invoice Ninja allows you to do this and oh so much more.',

    'question11' => 'Can I see what the application looks like with sample data?',
    'answer11' => 'Sure, <a href="https://www.invoiceninja.com/demo">click here</a> to try out our demo account.',

    'question12' => 'I hear that there\'s a version of Invoice Ninja that I can install myself on my own servers? Where can I learn more about this?',
    'answer12' => 'The rumors are true! Full instructions are available <a href="http://hillelcoren.com/invoice-ninja/self-hosting/" target="_blank">here</a>.',

    'question13' => 'I\'m seeing the options to assign various statuses to my invoices, clients, credits and payments. What\'s the difference between "active," "archived" and "deleted"?',
    'answer13' => 'These three handy statuses for invoices, clients, credits and payments allow you to keep your own cash flow management as straightforward and accessible as possible from your Invoice Ninja dashboard. None of these statuses will actually purge any records from your account - even "deleted" can always be recovered at any point in the future. "Active" means the record will appear in the relevant queue of records. To stash a record away so it\'s still fully operational but no longer cluttering up your interface, simply set it to be "archived." To deactivate a record and render it inaccessible to your clients, mark it "deleted."',

    'question14' => 'My question wasn\'t covered by any of the content on this FAQ page. How can I get in touch with you?',
    'answer14' => 'Please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@invoiceninja.com">contact@invoiceninja.com</a> with any questions or comments you have. We love hearing from the people who use our app! We’ll do our best to reply to your email within the business day.',

    'miss_something' => 'Did we miss something?',
    'miss_something_text' => 'Please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@invoiceninja.com" style="font-weight: bold">contact@invoiceninja.com</a> with any questions or comments you have. We love hearing from the people who use our app! We’ll do our best to reply to your email within the business day.',
